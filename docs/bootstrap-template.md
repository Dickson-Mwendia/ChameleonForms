# Twitter Bootstrap 3 Template

ChameleonForms has a built-in Twitter Bootstrap 3 template that you can switch to as part of [global configuration](configuration.md) or on a [per-form basis](form-template.md). This will allow you to rapidly develop forms for your Twitter Bootstrap 3 powered site (useful for quick prototyping), but give you the flexibility to easily change the template in the future if your quick prototype makes it big and warrants a custom redesign.

Support for Bootstrap 4 and other commonly used templates like Material will be added in the future. If you'd like to add support feel free to issue a [pull request](https://github.com/MRCollective/ChameleonForms/pulls).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get up and running with Twitter Bootstrap is to specify it as part of the global config:

1. In `Startup.cs` simply change your `AddChameleonForms` call to reference the `TwitterBootstrap3FormTemplate`:
    ```cs
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
        services.AddChameleonForms<TwitterBootstrap3FormTemplate>(...);
    }
    ```

2. If you already have Twitter Bootstrap referenced in your layout then [add the extra CSS and JavaScript files to get validation highlighting looking great](#chameleonforms-custom-css-and-javascript-to-complement-bootstrap)
3. [Create a ChameleonForm](getting-started.md) using the `BeginChameleonForm` extension method and you are good to go

## ChameleonForms custom CSS and JavaScript to complement Bootstrap

There are two files that ChameleonForms provides in the [`wwwroot/lib/chameleonforms` folder](configuration.md#msbuild-configuration) that you can optionally include in your Chameleon-powered Twitter Bootstrap form pages (or your layout if you want to include them across the site):

* [chameleonforms-twitterbootstrap.css](https://github.com/MRCollective/ChameleonForms/blob/master/ChameleonForms.Example/wwwroot/lib/chameleonforms/chameleonforms-twitterbootstrap.css)
    * Makes form hints a light grey even when the field is invalid (otherwise it would turn red making it look like an error)
    * Makes the required designator that ChameleonForms puts in looks better
    * Makes field labels for fields that don't have a `<label>` look the same as ones that do (bold) otherwise it looks weird
* [unobtrusive-twitterbootstrap3-validation.chameleonforms.js](https://github.com/MRCollective/ChameleonForms/blob/master/ChameleonForms.Example/wwwroot/lib/chameleonforms/unobtrusive-twitterbootstrap3-validation.chameleonforms.js)
    * Adds the `has-error` class to the field container when there is an unobtrusive validation error
    * Removes the `has-error` class from the field container when an invalid field (either from client-side or server-side validation) becomes valid when the user interacts with the field
    * Only supports jQuery validate unobtrusive validation, doesn't yet support [aspnet-validation](https://github.com/ryanelian/aspnet-validation)

## HTML Generation

You can find documentation about the HTML that is generated by the Twitter Bootstrap template across the ChameleonForms documentation:

* [Form HTML](the-form.md#twitter-bootstrap-3-html)
* [Message HTML](the-message.md#twitter-bootstrap-3-html) - including the documentation about how the ChameleonForms `MessageType` maps to the Twitter Bootstrap Emphasis Styles
* [Section HTML](the-section.md#twitter-bootstrap-3-html) - including top-level and nested sections
* [Navigation HTML](the-navigation.md#twitter-bootstrap-3-html) - including how to add icons to submit buttons, control their size and control their emphasis style (and a [great example of the options](the-navigation.md#example))
* [Field HTML](field.md#twitter-bootstrap-3-html) - including:
    * The HTML template it uses for inputs, textareas, select boxes, single checkboxes, radio/checkbox lists, file upload controls and other controls
    * The default required designator HTML ([which can be overriden](custom-template.md#field))
    * [How to create input groups](field.md#input-groups) with the `input-group-addon` class automatically added to appended and prepended content
    * The HTML for nested fields

## Horizontal and inline forms

The template doesn't currently support [horizontal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#forms-horizontal) or [inline](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#forms-inline) forms. If you create such templates then please send them to us in a [pull request](https://github.com/MRCollective/ChameleonForms/pulls) so we can include them in the main library.

## Modifications

If you think that the changes you want to make to the template are specific to your needs then you can [easily extend the template to change the bits you want](custom-template#applying-a-global-template-change) (just extend the `TwitterBootstrap3FormTemplate` class), while still using the work we have done (and subscribing to updates when you update the ChameleonForms NuGet package).
